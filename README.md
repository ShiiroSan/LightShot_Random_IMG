# LightShot Random Image
*This is more or less a PoC, if it doesn't work anymore this repo will just get archived.*\
I just made this to demonstrate that [LightShot](https://prnt.sc/) is **clearly not safe**.\
As [LightShot](https://prnt.sc/) host image forever, you can get them directly. This means anything you post on it can by seen by everyone.
Remember those nudes you posted before? ðŸ¤·

*I clearly recommend to use [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/).*

# FAQ
* Why sometimes the software do nothing when I click "Get New Image"?
  * The software is looking for every image that could exist based on an algorithm that could have a lot of false positive.\
  To avoid showing error image, the software search another image. Until it find something that's not an error.\
Which means, if you are really unlucky, it could try 10000 images before getting a new one working.

* What could I do to remove my screenshot then? I posted many critical things before...
  * Well... Try contact [LightShot](https://prnt.sc/).
